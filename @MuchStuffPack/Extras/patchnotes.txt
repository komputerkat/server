Patch notes:

Removed:
*All old fridges (the new ones remain) - If you have issues, wipe your server
*Some classes and items not finished

New:
*Snowball  fridge (thanks Creep for model)
*Integrated codelock. If you had it repacked before, you will want to remove it. You have a month to remove any repacked Codelock pbos i made for MSP, DMCA will be given after.

Changed:
*Greenhouses made compatibile with 1.12 - I recommend wiping due to the big changes of garden plots and greenhouses.

New Item list:
Msp_SnowballFridge_Kit
Msp_SnowballFridge

Codelock config:
MSP_CodeLockConfig.json found in CodeLock folder
```
{
    "RaidTimeInSeconds": 10.0,
    "CanAttach": "true",
    "CanRaid": "true",
    "DeleteLockOnRaid": "true",
    "ToolDamageOnRaid": 100,
    "RaidTools": [
        "Hacksaw"
    ]
}
```

RaidTimeInSeconds -> How long each wheel will take in seconds
CanAttach -> put "false" if you don't want to show the codelock category or give ability to attach codelock
CanRaid -> "true"/"false" enables raiding with the "RaidTools"
DeleteLockOnRaid -> If the CodeLock should be deleted on raid finish. Even if this is false, the codelock is still ruined
ToolDamageOnRaid -> How much damage the tool should take on completion of each wheel. Should be relative to the total health of the tool. E.g. If tool has 500 total health, and ToolDamageOnRaid is 100 then it will take 5 wheels to finish raiding.
RaidTools -> List of compatibile tools to raid with

NOTE: New key was used to sign the pbos. Make sure you copy the new one from Keys folder
