=>ToxicBloodLoss:
//Once you're higher that 100 in the quantity of toxicity in your character, 
you get sick then you start loosing 5 blood per time (every 3s I think). 
With that value, your character can survive about 25 min before falling uncounscious, 
so find the cure quickly or die ;)

=>NbSickGiven:
//Every minute if the client find that your character is unprotected, your character absorb/take AT MAX 34 toxicity sickness 
(knowing that you get sick at 100)
Now you only take a % of those 34 based on how many protection point you have. 
By default it's 6 point (requiredprotection). Each part provide one point.

So if I miss one part out of 6, it gives to the player (1 - 5/6) * 34 = 5.66

The formula is : ( 1 - (ProtectionFromYourClothe / RequiredProtection)) * NbSickGiven = How many sick point you get per minute

=>SuitsDamage:
//To reduce the cost of performance on the server, 
the damage of the suit are taken only when you enter a zone so by default, 
you can enter 4 times with a set without ruining the suit completely

=>GP5DamageGrenade:
//Every 15s, the gasmask take 10 health point as damage by the toxicgrenade

=>NbSickGivenforToxicSmoke:
//With this value, it takes less than a min to get sick without gasmask protection agasint a toxic grenade
