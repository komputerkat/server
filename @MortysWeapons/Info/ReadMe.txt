Morty's Weapons

1.10 compatable. (tested)

Info:
- I started this project a while back to learn a little bit about DayZ modding. 
- Keep in mind that issues may arise as BI games are very.... Interesting.
- I will not take requests for weapons as i add weapons that I feel like fit the game. (So do not expect any .50 cal snipers and so on)
- I work on these weapons on my free time so things might not be very speedy, but i have a good few new projects coming soon.
- Some of these weapons are not 100% correct when it comes to attachements, mags or ammo. It is made like this to be easy for server owners and not clutter the CE.
- "Realistic" versions will come at a later point. 
- Some of the models are made by me and some are bought. (Some are WIP.)

* .308 Stanag - Magazine for the MK216, SCAR-H and SR-25. They still take LAR mags, but you have the option.

* F&D Defence .338 also known as Helkhiana's Hellmaker :). A semiauto weapon with alot of firepower. Takes 10 round F&D Defence magazines and shoot a big .338 bullet. (should be rare)
* Honey Badger. A PDW that comes in both 5.56 and a new .300blk out round. It is compact and comparable to M4A1 but in a smaller package. The 5.56 version takes standard M4A1 mags and the 
.300blk takes .300blk Stanags and .300blk Cmags.

* M16A4. M4 type rifle. Uses 5.56 and standard M4 magazines. 
* .50 Beowulf. A high power AR15 type rifle that shoots .50 Beowulf round that hits like a truck. The high damage from the round is balanced by the bullet being very slow and 
the weapon having a slow rate of fire. Not great at longer ranges. But very good at short - mid ranges. Can attach standard M4 optics. Takes a 10 round .50 Beowulf Magazine. 
* VultAR DMR Mod-15. The VultAR is a modular designated marksman rifle. The consept is that a player builds his\her own rifle. Therfore it comes in two parts.
A rifle frame and two different barrels. One barrel for 5.56 and one barrel for 7.62x54. When combining the rifle frame and one of the barrels
you also have the option to choose a color. It comes in black, Tan, Two tone, Wood camo, Digi camo, Digi Tan, UPC and Snow.
To take the rifle apart you use a wrench.
* Barrett M82A1. A high power semi auto sniper rifle. Shoots a big .50 BMG round that hurts. Alot. This is a weapon ive said i will not add
for a long time, but its one of the most requested weapons. So i figured use it if you like, if not, dont.
I however recommend to have this weapon set to very rare if you add it to your server.
