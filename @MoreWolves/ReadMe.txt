Wolves, bears and zombies spawn everywhere!

More Wolves:
Infected wolves roam the cities, towns, villages, farms and coastlines alone or in small packs. Infected wolves will not provide edible meat when killed. The default wolf spawns still work the same, but have a slightly higher chance to occur and include Hollow's excellent Dire Wolf. Coastline villages and farms (in fact all built-up areas) are now dangerous places.
NEW: Stray dogs also roam the map. They don't howl, but they will attack players and provide 1x Dog Meat when skinned.

More Bears:
Infected bears can also be found all across the map. They are slightly weaker, less aggressive and not as aware of their surroundings than the default bears, but still highly dangerous! Infected bears will not provide edible meat when killed. Default bear spawns still work the same.

More Zombies:
Includes an edited version of the excellent ZombieSpawnOverhaul for increased zombie spawns.

Fully Customizable:
You can customize this mod to your liking. If you want to remove bears, wolves or zombies just edit the included territories.xml file.

If you want DayZ default zombie spawns, then just don't replace zombie_territories.xml.

If you want to replace the infected bears with docile bears that don't attack unless provoked, then replace any reference to Animal_InfectedBear with Animal_DocileBear in the server files provided. If you want default bears to spawn instead, replace Animal_InfectedBear with Animal_UrsusArctos.

If you don't want the new German Shepherd dogs spawning then replace any reference to Animal_GermanShepherd with Animal_InfectedWolf.


By default this mod is pretty hardcore. You can choose to spawn players with a weapon by using the provided init.c file or you can use my Better Loadouts mod.

If you choose to use the zombie_territories.xml provided in this mod, I suggest using with my Sneaky Zombies mod. Otherwise it might be too difficult!
