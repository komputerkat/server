//Coeff to calcule : (EndY-StartY)/(EndX-StartX);

=>YtoOrigin:
//YtoOrigin to calcule: StartY-Coeff*StartX;

=>Chance:
//chance to appear at restart between 0 and 1.0, multiply by 100 to get pÃªrcentage, it means 0.25 = 25% and 1.0 = 100%

=>Speed:
//Every 60s, the zone move of 30m.

=>Norme:
//It is used to calculate the time to reset the moving zone

=>IsOnlyGasMask:
//Set to 1 to allow only gasmask
//Set to 0 to disable gasmask

=>ParticleName:
//Particle name to get the smoke effect
