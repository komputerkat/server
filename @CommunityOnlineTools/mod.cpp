overview = "This is the first set of GUI based admin tools created by the developers of DayZ Community Offline Mode. This makes use of a modular design which allows other mods such as DayZ Expansion or DayZ HypeTrain to add their own menu's for admins to have further control of their servers. Community Online Tools allows you to teleport players, set player health, blood, shock, change the weather of the server and even spawn in vehicles. Also, this mod allows you to set the aiming mode for players to the old 0.62 system if you, the server admin wishes to use it.";
